intro to github

This is a test for the first commit of a new branch in the Hello world example.

The following is how you highlight python syntax with Markdown

```python
def foo():
    if not bar:
        return True
```

This is instead how you make text in bold, italic and add an html link:
It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)

This is instead how you refer to a diffente user:
@neighbour

This is how you implement task list with Markdown:

- [x] This is a complete item
- [ ] This is an incomplete item

This is how you create a table with Markdown:

Parameter | Blue | Red
------------ | ------------ | -------------
Alpha | -1.3 | -0.5
|||

Let's conclude with an emoji:
